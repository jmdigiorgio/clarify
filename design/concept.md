# Design Specification for Clarify App

## Overview

Clarify is a modern requirements management app designed for complex systems engineering. It aims to solve industry challenges around requirements tracking, organizing, and visualizing. The app will feature three primary interaction views: Graph, Table, and Document. Each view will offer unique ways to engage with requirements, whether users need a visual representation, a structured list, or detailed textual documentation. The target users are systems engineers and project managers who need to streamline requirement traceability and maintain clarity in large-scale projects.

## Key Features

- Graph View: A visual, graph-based representation of requirements and their interrelationships, leveraging a Neo4j database.
- Features: Ability to see connections between requirements, add/edit nodes, visualize dependencies.
- Interaction: Users can click nodes to view detailed properties or drag to adjust the layout for clarity.
- Table View: A structured list format of requirements, similar to a traditional spreadsheet.
- Features: Quick sorting, filtering, and bulk editing of requirements.
- Interaction: Editable cells and support for importing/exporting CSV files.
- Document View: A detailed text representation of requirements.
- Features: Rich-text editing, collaboration features for commenting on individual requirements.
- Interaction: Users can switch between the Table view and Document view for seamless edits.

## Architecture

- Frontend: Built using Next.js with MUI for UI components, to ensure a clean, responsive design that enhances user experience.
- Backend: Neo4j is used for storing requirements data, focusing on representing relationships effectively. A custom API facilitates interaction between the Next.js frontend and Neo4j database.
- Deployment: The app will be deployed using Vercel, providing scalability and ease of deployment for the frontend.

## User Workflow

- Splash Page: Upon launch, users will see a splash page offering options to choose between Graph, Table, or Document views.
- View Selection: Once a user selects a view, they are taken to the relevant interface, which offers the ability to toggle between views without losing context.
- Requirement Management: Users can create new requirements, establish relationships, edit attributes, and track requirement statuses across all views.

## Technical Requirements

- Database: Neo4j, optimized for graph-based requirements.
- Frontend: Next.js with MUI, React Hooks, and integration with Neo4j's data API.
- Backend: Node.js-based API that serves as a bridge between the frontend and Neo4j.

## Design Considerations

- User Experience: The interface should be intuitive, allowing for minimal learning curve. Effort is placed on drag-and-drop functionality in the Graph view, inline editing in Table view, and collaborative editing in Document view.
- Scalability: Neo4j is chosen for its ability to efficiently handle complex, interconnected data, ensuring that the application can scale with the needs of larger engineering projects.
- Deployment and Accessibility: Vercel ensures smooth deployment and scalability. The app must be accessible on both desktop and tablet devices to support different working environments.

## Future Extensions

- User Roles and Permissions: Implement a user management system to facilitate collaboration across teams while restricting access where necessary.
- Integration Capabilities: Potential integrations with tools like Jira or Confluence to further streamline workflows.
- Analytics Module: Provide data insights on requirement stability, traceability matrix, and dependency risk analysis.

## Timeline

- MVP Development: Aiming for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within three months, focusing on the three core views (Graph, Table, Document).
- Testing and Feedback: One month for alpha testing with a small group of users, followed by iterations based on feedback.

## Open Questions

- Should the initial release include basic collaboration tools (comments, history tracking), or should that be reserved for a later update?
- Would integrations with existing project management tools (such as Trello or Asana) be beneficial in the early stages, or should the focus remain solely on standalone functionality?
